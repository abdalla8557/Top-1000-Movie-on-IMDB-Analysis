# Top-1000-Movie-on-IMDB-Analysis

 Project Overview: IMDb Movie Data Analysis
Here, I decided to analyze something I’m truly passionate about — movies.
I sourced the data from Kaggle, which contains information about the Top 1000 highest-rated movies on IMDb.
The data spans 100 years, and I created an interactive dashboard to visualize trends across time.
Key metrics included:
Average IMDb rating of movies
Total box office revenue
Total number of IMDb votes
From the analysis:
Drama is the most common genre on the list, with a clear lead over Action.
The highest-rated movie is The Shawshank Redemption.
The most frequently appearing director is the legendary Alfred Hitchcock.
